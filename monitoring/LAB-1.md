# Cloud Monitoring: Qwik Start

Cloud Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. 
Cloud Monitoring collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, 
application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, 
Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others. Cloud Monitoring ingests that data and generates insights 
via dashboards, charts, and alerts. Cloud Monitoring alerting helps you collaborate by integrating with Slack, 
PagerDuty, HipChat, Campfire, and more.

In this lab you'll install monitoring and logging agents to collect information from your instance, which could include 
metrics and logs from 3rd party apps.
